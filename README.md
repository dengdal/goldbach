make will build the bash_goldbach.bin which searches for numbers which do not 
fulfill Goldbachs lesser known conjecture: odd_int = prime + 2a*a
where odd_int is any odd integer, prime is a prime number of free choice,
and a is an integer of free choice.

gen_primes.c and is_goldbach.c are just bonus files for possible separate use.
